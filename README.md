# Description

This assignment is meant for you to exercise the skills you've developed in CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 such that you implement a quick prototype of the Coding Club Membership project (from assignment one) with at least two ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0 views/forms which perform CRUD operations on the underlying schema and model.  This is by no means meant to be a complete application, rather, this is meant to demonstrate to me that you have the basic skills to be productive.  I am providing you with some guidelines/constraints for the project:
# Requirements

    Create at least two ASP.NET MVC Core 3.1 (using Razor pages or MVC) form/views that utilize a local SQLite database (DB file)
    Each form should facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your underlying model
    Each form should be from a different actor's perspective
